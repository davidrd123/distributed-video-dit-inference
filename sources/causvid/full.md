Figure 1. Traditional bidirectional diffusion models (top) deliver high-quality outputs but suffer from significant latency, taking 219
seconds to generate a 128-frame video. Users must wait for the entire sequence to complete before viewing any results. In contrast, we
distill the bidirectional diffusion model into a few-step autoregressive generator (bottom), dramatically reducing computational overhead.
Our model (CausVid) achieves an initial latency of only 1.3 seconds, after which frames are generated continuously in a streaming fashion
at approximately 9.4 FPS, facilitating interactive workflows for video content creation.
## Abstract
Current video diffusion models achieve impressive genera-
tion quality but struggle in interactive applications due to
bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a
single frame requires the model to process the entire se-
quence, including the future. We address this limitation by
adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to
an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-
fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution match-
ing distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffu-
sion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and
high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initializa-
tion scheme based on teacher’s ODE trajectories, as well as
an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal
student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach
effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive

generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite
training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of
84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all pre-
vious video generation models. It enables fast streaming
generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single
GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables
streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and
dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We release our
code and pretrained models.
## 1 Introduction
The emergence of diffusion models has revolutionized how
we can create videos from text [3, 5, 24, 28, 61, 96, 109].
Many of the state-of-the-art video diffusion models rely
on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture [2, 60],
which usually employs bidirectional attention across all
video frames. Despite the impressive quality, the bidirectional attention dependencies imply that generating a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future.

[Figure 2: Qualitative examples of tasks supported by the model. Rows show: (1) text-to-video with a prompt about “an over-the-shoulder camera shot” and “a huge lizard creature…”, (2) image-to-video with an example prompt “A little boy jumping in the air over a puddle of water.”, (3) video-to-video with inputs labeled “Input” and an example prompt about “a photorealistic video of a yellow sports car driving down a road…”, and (4) dynamic prompting where multiple prompts are injected over time (example narrative about a woman walking on a street, adjusting clothing, and taking a photo).]

Figure 2. Diverse video generation tasks supported by our method. The model can generate videos from a single text prompt (top row) or
with additional image input (second row). Our model also enables interactive applications where generation results respond to user input
with low latency. For example, it can add realistic texture and lighting to outputs rendered by a basic game engine that responds to user
input on the fly (third row). Additionally, it enables dynamic prompting (fourth row), allowing users to input new prompts at any point in
a video to build extended narratives with evolving actions and environments.
This introduces long
latency and prevents the model from being applied to inter-
active and streaming applications, where the model needs to
continually generate frames based on user inputs that may
change over time. The generation of the current frame de-
pends on future conditional inputs that are not yet available.
Current video diffusion models are also limited by their
speed. The compute and memory costs increase quadrati-
cally with the number of frames, which, combined with the
large number of denoising steps during inference, makes
generating long videos prohibitively slow and expensive.
Autoregressive models offer a promising solution to ad-
dress some of these limitations, but they face challenges
with error accumulation and computational efficiency. In-
stead of generating all frames simultaneously, autoregres-
sive video models generate frames sequentially. Users can
start watching the video as soon as the first frame is gener-
ated, without waiting for the entire video to be completed.
This reduces latency, removes limitations on video duration,
and opens the door for interactive control. However, autore-
gressive models are prone to error accumulation: each gen-
erated frame builds on potentially flawed previous frames,
causing prediction errors to magnify and worsen over time.
Moreover, although the latency is reduced, existing autore-
gressive video models are still far from being able to gener-
ate realistic videos at interactive frame rate [7, 28, 36].
In this paper, we introduce CausVid, a model designed
for fast and interactive causal video generation. We de-
sign an autoregressive diffusion transformer architecture
with causal dependencies between video frames. Similar to
the popular decoder-only large language models (LLMs) [6,
2
64], our model achieves sample-efficient training by lever-
aging supervision from all input frames at each iteration, as
well as efficient autoregressive inference through key-value
(KV) caching. To further improve generation speed, we
adapt distribution matching distillation (DMD) [99, 100],
a few-step distillation approach originally designed for im-
age diffusion models, to video data. Instead of naively
distilling an autoregressive diffusion model [8, 28] into a
few-step student, we propose an asymmetric distillation
strategy where we distill the knowledge in a pretrained
teacher diffusion model with bidirectional attention into
our causal student model. We show that this asymmet-
ric distillation approach significantly reduced error accu-
mulation during autoregressive inference. This allows us
to support autoregressively generating videos that are much
longer than the ones seen during training. Comprehen-
sive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves video
quality on par with state-of-the-art bidirectional diffusion
models while offering enhanced interactivity and speed. To
our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive video gener-
ation method that competes with bidirectional diffusion in
terms of quality (Appendix Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Additionally,
we showcase the versatility of our method in tasks such as
image-to-video generation, video-to-video translation, and
dynamic prompting, all achievable with extremely low la-
tency (Fig. 2).
## 2 Related Work
Autoregressive Video Generation. Given the inherent
temporal order of video data, it is intuitively appealing
to model video generation as an autoregressive process.
Early research uses either regression loss [19, 48] or GAN
loss [37, 57, 78, 81] to supervise the frame prediction
task. Inspired by the success of LLMs [6], some works
choose to tokenize video frames into discrete tokens and
apply autoregressive transformers to generate tokens one
by one [17, 36, 42, 86, 90, 95]. However, this approach
is computationally expensive as each frame usually con-
sists of thousands of tokens. Recently, diffusion models
have emerged as a promising approach for video genera-
tion. While most video diffusion models have bidirectional
dependencies [5, 61, 96, 109], autoregressive video gener-
ation using diffusion models has also been explored. Some
works [1, 28, 79, 104] train video diffusion models to de-
noise new frames given context frames. Others [8, 33, 68]
train the model to denoise the entire video under the set-
ting where different frames may have different noise levels.
Therefore, they support autoregressive sampling as a special
case where the current frame is noisier than previous ones.
A number of works have explored adapting pretrained text-
to-image [35, 41, 79, 88] or text-to-video [16, 22, 33, 91, 93]
diffusion models to be conditioned on context frames, en-
abling autoregressive video generation. Our method is
closely related to this line of work, with the difference that
we introduce a novel adaption method through diffusion
distillation, significantly improving efficiency and making
autoregressive methods competitive with bidirectional dif-
fusion for video generation.
Long Video Generation. Generating long and variable-
length videos remains a challenging task. Some works [11,
63, 77, 82, 83, 102, 106] generate multiple overlapped
clips simultaneously using video diffusion model pretrained
on fixed and limited-length clips, while employing vari-
ous techniques to ensure temporal coherence. Another ap-
proach is to generate long videos hierarchically, first gen-
erating sparse keyframes and then interpolating between
them [98, 107]. Unlike full-video diffusion models that
are trained to generate videos of fixed length, autoregres-
sive models [16, 22, 28, 42, 86, 91] are inherently suitable
for generating videos of various length, although they may
suffer from error accumulation when generating long se-
quences. We find that the distribution matching objective
with a bidirectional teacher is surprisingly helpful for re-
ducing the accumulation of errors, enabling both efficient
and high-quality long video generation.
Diffusion Distillation. Diffusion models typically require
many denoising steps to generate high-quality samples,
which can be computationally expensive [23, 73]. Distil-
lation techniques train a student model to generate samples
in fewer steps by mimicking the behavior of a teacher diffu-
sion model [29, 52, 59, 65, 69, 70, 76, 94, 100]. Luhman et
al. [52] train a single-step student network to approximate
the noise-image mapping obtained from a DDIM teacher
model [73]. Progressive Distillation [69] trains a sequence
of student models, reducing the number of steps by half at
each stage. Consistency Distillation [21, 32, 53, 74, 76]
trains the student to map any points on an ODE trajec-
tory to its origin. Rectified flow [14, 46, 47] trains a stu-
dent model on the linear interpolation path of noise-image
pairs obtained from the teacher. Adversarial loss [18] is
also used, sometimes in combination with other methods,
to improve the quality of student output [29, 44, 70, 94, 99].
DMD [99, 100] optimizes an approximate reverse KL di-
vergence [15, 54, 87, 97], whose gradients can be repre-
sented as the difference of two score functions trained on
the data and generator’s output distribution, respectively.
Unlike trajectory-preserving methods [32, 47, 69], DMD
provides supervision at the distribution level and offers the
unique advantage of allowing different architectural formu-
lations for the teacher and student diffusion models. Our ap-
proach builds upon the effectiveness and flexibility of DMD
to train an autoregressive generator by distilling from a bidi-
rectional teacher diffusion model.
Recently, researchers have begun to apply distillation
methods to video diffusion models, such as progressive dis-

tillation [43], consistency distillation [39, 56, 84, 85], and
adversarial distillation [56, 105]. Most approaches focus
on distilling models designed to generate short videos (less
than 2 seconds). Moreover, they focus on distilling a non-
causal teacher into a student that is also non-causal. In con-
trast, our method distills a non-causal teacher into a causal
student, enabling streaming video generation. Our gener-
ator is trained on 10-second videos and can generate in-
5
finitely long videos via sliding window inference. There
has been another line of work that focuses on improving the
efficiency of video diffusion models by system-level opti-
mization (e.g., caching and parallelism) [45, 103, 108, 112].
However, they are usually applied to standard multi-step
diffusion models and can be combined with our distillation
approach, further improving the throughput and latency.
## 3 Background
This section provides background information on video dif-
fusion models (Sec. 3.1) and distribution matching distilla-
tion (Sec. 3.2), which our method is built upon.
### 3.1 Video Diffusion Models
Diffusion models [23, 72] generate samples from a data dis-
tribution p(x0) by progressively denoising samples that are
initially drawn from a Gaussian distribution p(xT ). They
are trained to denoise samples created by adding random
noise ϵ to the samples x0 from the data distribution:

$$x_t = \alpha_t x_0 + \sigma_t \epsilon,\quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I). \tag{1}$$

where αt, σT > 0 are scalars that jointly define the signal-
to-noise ratio according to a specific noise schedule [30, 34,
75] at step t. The denoiser with parameter θ is typically
trained to predict the noise [23]

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon}\left\lVert \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) - \epsilon \right\rVert_2^2. \tag{2}$$

Alternative prediction targets include the clean image
x0 [30, 69] or a weighted combination of x0 and ϵ known
as v-prediction [69]. All prediction schemes are fundamen-
tally related to the score function, which represents the gra-
dient of the log probability of the distribution [34, 75]:

$$s_\theta(x_t, t) = \nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t) = -\frac{\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)}{\sigma_t}. \tag{3}$$

In the following sections, we simplify our notation by us-
ing the score function sθ as a general representation of the
diffusion model, while noting that it can be derived through
reparameterization from a pretrained model of any predic-
tion scheme. At inference time, we start from full Gaussian
noise xT and progressively apply the diffusion model to
generate a sequence of increasingly cleaner samples. There
are many possible sampling methods [30, 51, 73, 101] to
compute the sample xt−1 in the next time step from the cur-
rent one xt based on the predicted noise ϵθ(xt, t).
Diffusion models can be trained on either raw data [23,
27, 30] or on a lower-dimensional latent space obtained by
a variational autoencoder (VAE) [31, 60, 66, 96, 109]. The
latter is often referred to as latent diffusion models (LDMs)
and has become the standard approach for modeling high-
dimensional data such as videos [4, 25, 96, 109, 111]. The
autoencoder usually compresses both spatial and temporal
dimensions of the video, making diffusion models easier to
learn. The denoiser network in video diffusion models can
be instantiated by different neural architectures, such as U-
Net [10, 24, 67, 111] or Transformers [5, 25, 80, 96].
### 3.2 Distribution Matching Distillation
Distribution matching distillation is a technique designed
to distill a slow, multi-step teacher diffusion model into an
efficient few-step student model [99, 100]. The core idea
is to minimize the reverse KL divergence across randomly
sampled timesteps t between the smoothed data distribu-
tion pdata(xt) and the student generator’s output distribution
pgen(xt). The gradient of the reverse KL can be approxi-
mated as the difference between two score functions:

$$
\nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{DMD}} \triangleq \mathbb{E}_t\!\left(\nabla_\phi \mathrm{KL}(p_{\mathrm{gen},t}\|p_{\mathrm{data},t})\right)
\approx -\mathbb{E}_t \left[ \int \left( s_{\mathrm{data}}(\Psi(G_\phi(\epsilon), t), t) - s_{\mathrm{gen},\xi}(\Psi(G_\phi(\epsilon), t), t) \right) \frac{dG_\phi(\epsilon)}{d\phi}\, d\epsilon \right]. \tag{4}
$$

where Ψ represents the forward diffusion process as defined
in Eq. 1, ϵ is random Gaussian noise, Gϕ is the generator
parameterized by ϕ, and sdata and sgen,ξ represent the score
functions trained on the data and generator’s output distri-
bution, respectively, using a denoising loss (Eq. 2).
During training, DMD [100] initializes both score func-
tions from a pre-trained diffusion model. The score function
of the data distribution is frozen, while the score function of
the generator distribution is trained online using the genera-
tor’s outputs. Simultaneously, the generator receives gradi-
ents to align its output with the data distribution (Eq. 4).
DMD2 [99] extends this framework from single-step to
multi-step generation by replacing the pure random noise
input ϵ with a partially denoised intermediate image xt.
## 4 Methods
Our approach introduces an autoregressive diffusion trans-
former that enables sequential video generation (Sec. 4.1).
We show our training procedure in Fig. 6, which uses
asymmetric distillation (Sec. 4.2) and ODE initializa-
tion (Sec. 4.3) to achieve high generation quality and sta-
ble convergence. We achieve efficient streaming inference
through KV caching mechanisms (Sec. 4.4).
### 4.1 Autoregressive Architecture
We begin by compressing the video into a latent space us-
ing a 3D VAE. The VAE encoder processes each chunk of
video frames independently, compressing them into shorter
chunks of latent frames. The decoder then reconstructs
the original video frames from each latent chunk. Our
causal diffusion transformer operates in this latent space,
[Figure 5: Autoregressive diffusion transformer overview. A horizontal “AR-DiT” block indicates sequential generation. Three “Noisy Frame” examples are shown below; arrows indicate that tokens in the current frame attend to tokens from the current and previous frames (causal across chunks), not future frames.]

Figure 5. Overview of our autoregressive diffusion transformer architecture. Tokens in the current frame only attend to tokens from current
and previous frames, but not the future.
generating latent frames sequentially. We design a block-
wise causal attention mechanism inspired by prior works
that combine autoregressive models with diffusion [38, 40,
49, 110]. Within each chunk, we apply bidirectional self-
attention among latent frames to capture local temporal de-
pendencies and maintain consistency. To enforce causal-
ity, we apply causal attention across chunks. This prevents
frames in the current chunk from attending to frames in fu-
ture chunks. A visual illustration of the architecture of our
autoregressive diffusion transformer is provided in Fig. 5.
Our design maintains the same latency as fully causal at-
tention, as the VAE decoder still requires at least a block
of latent frames to generate pixels. Formally, we define the
attention mask M as

$$
M_{i,j} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \left\lfloor \frac{j}{k} \right\rfloor \le \left\lfloor \frac{i}{k} \right\rfloor, \\\\
0, & \\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\tag{5}
$$

Here, i and j index the frames in the sequence, k is the
chunk size, and ⌊·⌋ denotes the floor function.
Our diffusion model Gϕ extends the DiT architec-
ture [60] for autoregressive video generation. We introduce
block-wise causal attention masks to the self-attention lay-
ers (illustrated in Fig. 6) while preserving the core structure,
allowing us to leverage pretrained bidirectional weights for
faster convergence.
### 4.2 Bidirectional → Causal Generator Distillation
A straightforward approach to training a few-step causal
generator would be through distillation from a causal

Figure 6. Our method distills a many-step, bidirectional video diffusion model sdata into a 4-step, causal generator Gϕ. The training
process consists of two stages. (top) Student Initialization: we initialize the causal student by pretraining it on a small set of ODE solution
pairs generated by the bidirectional teacher (Sec. 4.3). This step helps stabilize the subsequent distillation training. (bottom) Asymmetric

denoises each chunk sequentially, conditioned on the pre-
viously generated clean chunks of frames. While distill-
ing this fine-tuned autoregressive diffusion teacher appears
promising in theory, our initial experiments indicated that
this naive approach yields suboptimal results. Since causal
diffusion models typically underperform their bidirectional
counterparts, training a student model from a weaker causal
teacher inherently limits the student’s capabilities. More-
over, issues such as error accumulation would propagate
from teacher to student. To overcome the limitations of a
causal teacher, we propose an asymmetric distillation ap-
proach: following state-of-the-art video models [5, 61], we
employ bidirectional attention in the teacher model while
constraining the student model to causal attention (Fig. 6
bottom). Algorithm 1 details our training process.
### 4.3 Student Initialization
Directly training the causal student model using the DMD
loss can be unstable due to architectural differences. To ad-
dress this, we introduce an efficient initialization strategy to
stabilize training (Fig. 6 top).
We create a small dataset of ODE solution pairs gener-
ated by the bidirectional teacher model:
- Sample a sequence of noise inputs {xi
T }L
i=1 from the
standard Gaussian distribution L(0, I).
- Simulate the reverse diffusion process with an ordinary
differential equation (ODE) solver [73] using the pre-
trained bidirectional teacher model to obtain the corre-
sponding ODE trajectory {xi
t}L
i=1, where t spans T to 0,
covering all inference timesteps.
From the ODE trajectories, we select a subset of t values
that match those used in our student generator. The student
model is then trained on this dataset with a regression loss:
Linit = Ex,ti ||Gϕ({xi
ti }N
i=1, {ti
}N
i=1) − {xi
0}N
i=1||2
, (6)
where the few-step generator Gϕ is initialized from the
teacher model. Our ODE initialization is computationally
efficient, requiring only a small number of training itera-
tions on relatively few ODE solution pairs.
### 4.4 Efficient Inference with KV Caching
During inference, we generate video frames sequentially
using our autoregressive diffusion transformer with KV
caching for efficient computation [6]. We show the de-
tailed inference procedure in Algorithm 2. Notably, because
we employ KV caching, block-wise causal attention is no
longer needed at inference time. This allows us to leverage
a fast bidirectional attention implementation [12].
## 5 Experiments
Models. Our teacher model is a bidirectional DiT [60] with
an architecture similar to CogVideoX [96]. The model is
trained on the latent space produced by a 3D VAE that en-
codes 16 video frames into a latent chunk consisting of 5
latent frames. The model is trained on 10-second videos at

a resolution of 352 × 640 and 12 FPS. Our student model
has the same architecture as the teacher, except that it em-
ploys causal attention where each token can only attend
to other tokens within the same chunk and in preceding
chunks. Each chunk contains 5 latent frames. During in-
ference, it generates one chunk at a time using 4 denois-
ing steps, with inference timesteps uniformly sampled as
[999, 748, 502, 247]. We use FlexAttention [20] for efficient
attention computation during training.
Training. We distill our causal student model using a mixed
set of image and video datasets following CogVideoX [96].
Images and videos are filtered based on safety and aesthetic
scores [71]. All videos are resized and cropped to the train-
ing resolution (352 × 640) and we use around 400K single-
shot videos from an internal dataset, for which we have full
copyright. During training, we first generate 1000 ODE
pairs (Sec. 4.3) and train the student model for 3000 iter-
ations with AdamW [50] optimizer and a learning rate of
5 × 10−6
. After that, we train with our asymmetric DMD
loss (Sec. 4.2) with the AdamW optimizer and a learning
rate of 2 × 10−6
for 6000 iterations. We use a guidance
scale of 3.5 and adopt the two time-scale update rule from
DMD2 [99] with a ratio of 5. The whole training process
takes around 2 days on 64 H100 GPUs.
Evaluation. Our method is evaluated on VBench [26], a
benchmark for video generation with 16 metrics designed
to systematically assess motion quality and semantic align-
ment. For our main results, we use the first 128 prompts
from MovieGen [61] to generate videos and evaluate model
performance on three primary aspects from VBench compe-
tition’s evaluation suite. A comprehensive evaluation using
all prompts from VBench is provided in the appendix. The
inference times are measured on a H100 GPU.

ator with its teacher model and existing video diffusion models.
Our model demonstrates superior video quality (scores > 50%),
while achieving a significant reduction in latency by multiple or-
ders of magnitude.
### 5.1 Text to Video Generation
We evaluate the ability of our approach to generate short
videos (5 to 10 seconds) and compare it against state-of-
the-art methods: CogVideoX [96], OpenSORA [109], Pyra-
mid Flow [28], and MovieGen [61]. As shown in Tab. 1,
our method outperforms all baselines across all three key
metrics: temporal quality, frame quality, and text align-
ment. Our model achieves the highest temporal quality
score of 94.7, indicating superior motion consistency and
dynamic quality. In addition, our method shows notable
improvements in frame quality and text alignment, scoring
64.4 and 30.1, respectively. In the supplementary material,
we present our method’s performance on the VBench-Long
leaderboard, achieving a total score of 84.27 and securing
first place among all officially evaluated video generation
models.
We further evaluate our model’s performance through a
human preference study. We select the first 29 prompts from
the MovieGenBench dataset and collect ratings from inde-
pendent evaluators using the Prolific platform. For each pair
of compared models and each prompt, we collect 3 ratings
from different evaluators, resulting in a total of 87 ratings
per model pair. The evaluators choose the better video be-
tween the two generated videos based on the visual quality
and semantic alignment with the input prompt. The specific
questions and interface are shown in Appendix Fig. 11. For
reproducibility, we use a fixed random seed of zero for all
videos. As illustrated in Fig. 7, our model consistently out-
performs baseline methods such as MovieGen, CogVideoX,
and Pyramid Flow. Notably, our distilled model maintains
performance comparable to the bidirectional teacher while
offering orders of magnitude faster inference, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.
We also compare our method with prior works de-
9
signed for long video generation: Gen-L-Video [82],
FreeNoise [63], StreamingT2V [22], FIFO-Diffusion [33],
and Pyramid Flow [28]. We use a sliding window infer-
ence strategy, taking the final frames of the previous 10-
second segment as context for generating the next segment.
The same strategy is also applied to generate long videos
using Pyramid Flow. Tab. 2 shows that our method out-
performs all baselines in terms of temporal quality and
frame-wise quality and is competitive in text alignment. It
also successfully prevents error accumulation. As shown in
Fig. 8, our method maintains image quality over time, while
most autoregressive baselines suffer from quality degrada-
tion [8, 22, 28].
Tab. 3 compares the efficiency of our method with com-
peting approaches [28, 96] and our bidirectional teacher dif-
fusion model. Our method achieves a 160× reduction in
latency and a 16× improvement in throughput compared to
the similarly scaled CogVideoX [96].

distillation. We apply causal attention masks to the model
and fine-tune it with the autoregressive training method de-
scribed in Sec. 4.2. As shown in Tab. 4, the many-step
causal model performs substantially worse than the origi-
nal bidirectional model. We observe that the causal baseline
suffers from error accumulation, leading to rapid degrada-
tion in generation quality over time (orange in Fig. 8 ).
We then conduct an ablation study on our distillation
framework, examining the student initialization scheme and
the choice of teacher model. Tab. 4 shows that given the
same ODE initialization scheme (as introduced in Sec. 4.3),
the bidirectional teacher model outperforms the causal
teacher model and is also much better than the initial ODE-
fitted model (where we denote the teacher as None). As
shown in Fig. 8, the causal diffusion teacher suffers from
significant error accumulation (orange), which is then trans-
ferred to the student model (green). In contrast, we find that
our causal student model trained with our asymmetric DMD
loss and a bidirectional teacher (blue) performs much bet-
ter than the many-step causal diffusion model, highlighting
the importance of distillation for achieving both fast and
high-quality video generation. With the same bidirectional
teacher, we demonstrate that initializing the student model
by fitting the ODE pairs can further enhance performance.
While our student model improves upon the bidirectional
teacher for frame-by-frame quality, it performs worse in
temporal flickering and output diversity.
### 5.3 Applications
In addition to text-to-video generation, our method supports
a broad range of other applications. We present quantitative
results below, with qualitative samples in Fig. 2. We provide
additional video results in the supplementary material.

method on the task of streaming video-to-video translation,
which aims to edit a streaming video input that can have
unlimited frames. Inspired by SDEdit [58], we inject noise
corresponding to timestep t1 into each input video chunk
and then denoise it in one step conditioned on the text. We
compare our method with StreamV2V [41], a state-of-the-
art method for this task that builds upon image diffusion
models. From 67 video-prompt pairs used in StreamV2V’s
user study (originally from the DAVIS [62] dataset), we
select all 60 videos that contain at least 16 frames. For
a fair comparison, we do not apply any concept-specific
fine-tuning to either method. Tab. 5 shows that our method
outperforms StreamV2V, demonstrating improved temporal
consistency due to the video prior in our model.

Image to Video Generation Our model can perform text-
conditioned image-to-video generation without any addi-
tional training. Given a text prompt and an initial im-
age, we duplicate the image to create the first segment of
frames. The model then autoregressively generates subse-
quent frames to extend the video. We achieve compelling
results despite the simplicity of this approach. We evalu-
ate against CogVideoX [96] and Pyramid Flow [28] on the
VBench-I2V benchmark, as these are the primary baselines
capable of generating 6-10 second videos. As shown in
Table 6, our method outperforms existing approaches with
notable improvements in dynamic quality. We believe in-
struction fine-tuning with a small set of image-to-video data
could further enhance our model’s performance.

## 6 Discussion
Although our method is able to generate high-quality videos
up to 30 seconds, we still observe quality degradation when
generating videos that are extremely long. Developing more
effective strategies to address error accumulation remains
future work. Moreover, while the latency is significantly
lower—by multiple orders of magnitude—compared to pre-
vious approaches, it remains constrained by the current
VAE design, which necessitates the generation of five la-
tent frames before producing any output pixels. Adopting a
more efficient frame-wise VAE could reduce latency by an
additional order of magnitude, significantly improving the
model’s responsiveness.
Finally, while our method produces high-quality samples
using the DMD objective, it comes with reduced output di-
versity. This limitation is characteristic of reverse KL-based
distribution matching approaches. Future work could ex-
plore alternative objectives such as EM-Distillation [92] and
Score Implicit Matching [55], which may better preserve
the diversity of outputs.
While our current implementation is limited to gener-
ating videos at around 10 FPS, standard engineering opti-
mizations (including model compilation, quantization, and
parallelization) could potentially enable real-time perfor-
mance. We believe our work marks a significant advance-
ment in video generation and opens up new possibilities
for applications in robotic learning [13, 89], game render-
ing [7, 79], streaming video editing [9], and other scenarios
that require real-time and long-horizon video generation.

A. VBench-Long Leaderboard Results
We evaluate CausVid on the VBench-Long dataset using
all 946 prompts across 16 standardized metrics. We refer
readers to the VBench paper [26] for a detailed description
of the metrics. As shown in Tab. 7, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with the highest total score of
### 84.27 The radar plot in Fig. 10 visualizes our method’s
comprehensive performance advantages. Our method is
significantly ahead in several key metrics including dy-
namic degree, aesthetic quality, imaging quality, object
class, multiple objects, and human action. More details can
be found on the official benchmark website (https://
huggingface.co/spaces/Vchitect/VBench_
